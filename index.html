      <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This is me, Tanish Arora and it’s my first year of studying Bachelors of Information Technology at RMIT. My student number is – 3930389, my personal email – tanishosr0909@gmail.com and my student email is- s3930389@student.rmit.edu.au .</h5>
<h5>I have completed my Secondary Education from Cambridge Foundation School in New Delhi, India.</h5>
<h5>I come from an Indian family, my parents are currently living in India and I am living with my Aunt, brothers and sisters here in Melbourne. Hindi is my native language and I can speak English and a little bit (“poco poco”) Spanish too. </h5>
<h5>I love to play cricket and I play with my brother from a club “Royal Challengers Berwick” (RCB), (IPL lovers may know that). Basically, I am a right arm fast bowler and know how to trick the batsman and I can do batting too, if my team needs me.</h5>
<h5>So that was about my sport life, but I’m a bit involved in gaming too. PUBG mobile is my favourite game, my brother and I made a pretty good team and we have played competitive matches also. So I am a bit of a pro player in PUBG. </h5>
<h5>For some fun time I usually play UNO or Kahoot with my siblings.

      <h1>Interest In IT</h1>
      <h6 class="w3-padding-32">When it comes to ‘interest’, I have always been interested in IT since I was 10. I always loved technology and always tried to explore it in my own ways. I usually observe any new tech item that I have and like to master it as fast as I can. When I was 14, I started reading science and tech magazines that made my interest in Artificial Intelligence. </h6>
<h6>As I am daily exploring AI, I get new ideas that where can I use AI to improve my surroundings like in cars, kitchen, smart homes, banks, stadiums and many more like that.</h6>
<h6>I don’t have any work experience in IT but I can easily develop new ideas which can help the future generations.</h6>

      <h1>Why did I choose RMIT ?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">I choose the (RMIT) Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology for my Bachelor of IT as this university is one of the best in IT. RMIT is a global university of technology, design and enterprise with more than 96,000 students and 9,000 staff globally. RMIT's mission is to help shape the world through research, innovation, quality teaching and engagement, and to create transformative experiences for students, getting them ready for life and work.</h5>
<h5>RMIT is the 5th ranked in Australia in Student Global Mobility, 3rd ranked globally in THE Impact Rankings and 206th globally in QS World University Rankings (2022).</h5>
<h5>These type of facts helped me decide that why should I choose RMIT and add as much as I can to the university.
In my course I expect to build my IT skills and go deeper and explore as much as I can. I get a lot of IT ideas but don’t know how to implement them and here comes RMIT, which is going to help me through this and teach me how and when to implement my skills. </h5>

      <img src="jobimage.jpeg" alt="rmit image" width="400" height="350">
      <h3>Why do I want to be a Manager in this field?</h3>
      <h6 class="w3-padding-32">A cyber security Manager perform technology risk assessments, manage security related reviews, work closely with other Risk Consulting team members in delivery of reviews, assists partners/principals in business development activities, manage engagements, mentor and coach the team, help identify improvement opportunities for clients and write/QA reports, manage completion of each assignment, being accountable for high-quality standards, and provide client management with guidance on IT security risk management.</h6>
<h6>So as you can see that this manager position offers $130,000-$170,000 dollars per annum which no one can unsee and I am quite interested in this job.
Cyber security is a field which I have been liking a lot from the past 4-5 years and I want to make this my profession in the future.
When covid-19 started everything came online office meetings, school, college and many more, but in all of this there was a lot of crime which can only be handled by cyber security, you get to help and mentor your team which shows your leadership qualities which I can do. This is the reason this position is appealing to me.
</h6>
<h4>Requirements for the Job</h4>
<h6>In this job a minimum of 5-9 years’ experience is required in IT technical delivery, IT audit, internal controls/risk management, relevant tertiary degree and professional certification is essential, some experience performing and managing security risk assessments against cybersecurity or information security standards or governance frameworks, knowledge of IT, outstanding interpersonal and communications skills, able to communicate effectively in verbal and written format with technical and non-technical audiences, experience managing a client portfolio, able to provide first class service in response to client demands and excellent attention to detail and prioritising skills, able to produce high quality work autonomously and as part of a team.
<h4>How will I obtain the skills ?</h4>
<h6>Currently I don’t have any experience in IT Technical Delivery and also don’t have a professional certificate.
For qualifications I’m currently doing Bachelor of IT which comes in tertiary degree and for the professional certification after I have my tertiary degree, I can do training in a company which will give me a certificate, like IBM, ANZ and many more. It also requires an experience of at least 5 years, for which I will have to do a job in the IT technical delivery. While doing this job I will gain experience in performing and managing security risk assessments against cybersecurity or information security standards or governance frameworks.
And when it comes to communication skills, that’s not a problem because I’m pretty good in communicating with anyone, like the newest generation that is technical and the non-technical audience that is the previous generation in both verbal and written formats. I can also produce high quality work autonomously and as a part of team. After the 5-7 years job experience I will be able to provide first class service in response to client demands and excellent attention to detail and prioritising skills.</h6>
<h6>After doing all this step by step I see myself as the Manager at the age of 26.

  <h2>AI SMART HOME</h2>

<div class="w3-row-padding w3-padding-64 w3-container">
  <div class="w3-content">
    <div class="w3-center">

      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <h6>This project is going to be about a home having “AI”, the one of the best technologies of the coming decades. This type of home will be able to help anyone of any age having any disability. This home can be controlled by your phone, remote as well as your voice. This is going to be an anti-theft home which will ensure the protection of your family because nowadays it’s very important. This tech will make your life easier so that you can spend time with your family and focus on your studies and work rather than the stress of maintaining your house.

</h6>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<h6>So there are a lot of people in the world who need this technology in their life to make a big difference. The people who are in need can be those ones who love “AI” and aged people who can’t help themselves, people and children with a disabilities and families with a lot of people too. In 2020, there were an estimated 727 million persons aged 65 years or over worldwide. This number is projected to more than double by 2050, reaching over 1.5 billion persons. The share of older persons in the global population is expected to increase from 9.3 per cent in 2020 to 16.0 per cent in 2050. There are a total number of 15% people in the world who are disabled and this “AI SMART HOME” can give them a nice life. People with big houses often have to take leave from work to maintain their house and this keeps them busy. This shows the need for the technology. Everyone might think that this “AI SMART HOME” would be expensive but to make this project work for everyone, the government must take this project into action and help their people.</h6>
<img src="smart.JPG" alt="smart home picture" width="400" height="350">
<h1>Description</h1>
<h6>This “AI SMART HOME” will be a home in which everything will be controlled either by a phone app or remote or a voice program, whichever you like. This project idea will help you maintain the whole house. ‘An AI Programmed Voice Assistant’ - which I call – “ANDY” which can help you to make the light go off and on, can unlock and lock your main door while you are in your room, move the curtains, play any song, any colour of lighting that you need and can do many more things because everything in the house will be programmed.</h6>
<h6>In this program the centre of taking commands will be “ANDY”, you just have to give a command to ANDY and he will do anything manually or will forward the command to the robots, which can do the physical stuff.</h6>
<h6>There will be AI robots (that look like humans) which will do everything you need them to, like mowing, sweeping, cleaning, moving the furniture as you wish, making food for family dinner or parties and many more tasks.</h6>
<h6>ANDY can be a great asset to your home like whenever there is an emergency like fire, flooding or a fight or anything, ANDY will be programmed the way to detect any situation and act accordingly.</h6>
<h6>Now the most important topic comes that, “Can someone break into your house ?”</h6>
<h6>Obviously No, and that’s because every member of the house will be recognised and if a stranger comes to the door, ANDY will automatically ask their name and will ask one of the adults to open the door and if the stranger tries to enter the house forcefully ANDY will automatically call the police and will lock every door of the house until further commanded by any member. </h6>
<h6>So it’s a safe and friendly SMART HOME for everyone.
The robots can even play with the people as they wish, like play xbox, playstation, football, cricket, kahoot, uno, chess, and any more outdoor, indoor and board games too.</h6>
<h6>ANDY also keep track of everyone’s health, like ‘how many weight did a person lose in 10 days’, number of steps in a day or month, heart rate and many more and can even remind you to take your medicines as prescribed by the doctor.</h6>
<h6>ANDY can also help small children like play with them, teach them whatever the parents say and many more.
ANDY will be programmed to speak all the languages for everyone’s ease.
</h6>
<h1>Tools and Technology</h1>
<h6>H20 (Open Source AI Platform) is an open-source deep learning  platform. It is an AI tool which is business oriented and help them to make a decision from data and enables the user to draw insights. There are two open source versions of it: one is standard H2O and other is paid version Sparkling Water. It can be used for predictive modelling, risk and fraud analysis, insurance analytics, advertising technology, healthcare and customer intelligence.
</h6>
<h6>Google ML Kit, Google’s machine learning beta SDK for mobile developers, is designed to enable developers to build personalised features on Android and IOS phones.
The kit allows developers to embed machine learning technologies with app-based APIs running on the device or in the cloud. These include features such as face and text recognition, barcode scanning, image labelling and more.</h6>
<h6>Auto ML software helps up build software. AutoML is a library which is used by many Machine learning engineers to optimize their models.
Build a smart assistant using open-source services and APIs like Wit.ai or Jasper.</h6>

<h6>Research is also going to be a big part of this in my lifetime to make this because I don’t know everything about, how to make software and how to use hardwares.
</h6>
<h1>Skills Required</h1>
<h6>To make a SMART HOME like this I would need to understand that how to use APIs, C++, Python, Html, and how to use some Open Source AI Platforms, some mechanical knowledge on how to build a robot.</h6>
<h6>To acquire these skills it's going to take a lot of time but with dedication I will make this one day by acquiring all the skills.
</h6>
<h1>Outcome</h1>
<h6>If this project “AI SMART HOME” comes into play it will change everything. It's just that the every country’s government have to support their people to make them supply this technology because to have this type of “AI SMART HOME” is not everyone’s cup of tea. </h6>
<h6>It should first be installed in the public places like airports, railway stations, public malls, orphanages, old age homes and more public places like these.</h6>
<h6>This development will increase the chances for everyone to grow in their life as well as enjoy it too. </h6>
<h6>IT WILL BE A REVOLUTION IF THIS PROJECT BECOMES SUCCESSFUL.
